# FPGA Digital Logic Development

This repository documents a series of FPGA projects demonstrating combinational and sequential circuit design using Verilog.

## Overview
- Completed as part of the Digital Logic Design Laboratory at Rutgers University.
- Implemented and verified digital subsystems on FPGA hardware.

## Circuits Implemented
- SR Latch and D Flip-Flop  
- 4-bit ALU  
- Gray Encoder/Decoder  
- Traffic Light Finite State Machine (FSM)

## Tools and Hardware
- Xilinx Vivado for simulation and synthesis  
- Nexys A7 FPGA development board  
- 74LS-series ICs for discrete hardware verification

## Results
- Synthesized Verilog designs and validated logic timing.
- Observed accurate functional behavior on FPGA with LED output mapping.
